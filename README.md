## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Percentage calculation.
- Clearing the display (CE) and the entire equation (C).
- Changing the sign of the current number (+/-).
- Adding decimal points.
- Accurate evaluation of mathematical expressions using the eval() function.
- User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) with a modern and sleek design.

## Requirements
To run this calculator app, you need:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The ttkbootstrap library for styling the application.

You can install ttkbootstrap using pip:


```
pip install ttkbootstrap
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd calculator-app
```

3. Run the calculator app:
```
python calculator.py
```
4. Start performing calculations with the user-friendly interface.

## How It Works
- The calculator app is implemented as a Python class (Calculator) that inherits from the ttk.Frame class.
- It uses the ttkbootstrap library for styling buttons and labels.
- The main components of the calculator are the display, numerical keypad, and event handlers for button clicks.
- Arithmetic operations are performed by constructing a mathematical expression as a string and then evaluating it using the eval() function.
- The app handles edge cases like changing the sign of a number, adding decimal points, and calculating percentages.
